# HSE - Hidden Sound Explorer

Hidden Sound Explorer is a circuit that transduces the electromagnetic fields, produced by the electronic devices that surround us, into sounds to be listened to through earphones.
It amplifies the electrical signal of a coil connected to the input, a two-pole connector. A piezoelectric disc (contact microphone) can also be connected to the input terminals to amplify micro-sounds that are normally inaudible.

The output is a 1/8" stereo jack in which you can plug your
headphones to discover a new world of hidden sounds.

Use a 100mH inductor to scope out power supplies, electric motors, smartphones.
Any electromagnetic source will produce a distinct sound. 
Also a piezo disk attached to a vibrating surface can reveal some unheard sounds.
Use it on guitar, violin, toothpicks or a broom...whatever.
