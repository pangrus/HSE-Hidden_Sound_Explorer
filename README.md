# HSE - Hidden Sound Explorer

Hidden Sound Explorer is a circuit that allows to amplify small voltages
coming from piezo-electric transducers or from inductors (coils).

The output is a 1/8" stereo jack in which you can plug your
headphones to discover a new world of hidden sounds.

Use a 100mH inductor to scope out power supplies, electric motors, smartphones.
Any electromagnetic source will produce a distinct sound. 
Also a piezo disk attached to a vibrating surface can reveal some unheard sounds.
Use it on guitar, violin, toothpicks or a broom...whatever.

In this repository you can find the schematic and the PCB production files to build your own device.

Enjoy.
